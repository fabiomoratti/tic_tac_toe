# Reinforcement learning demo
A simple demo showing an agent that "learns" to play Tic Tac Toe.

## Credits
The script has been developed by [Jeremy Zhang](https://github.com/MJeremy2017), 
[here](https://github.com/MJeremy2017/Reinforcement-Learning-Implementation/tree/master/TicTacToe) is the original repo
 I modified it to present a more usable user interface.
